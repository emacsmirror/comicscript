comicscript
===========

An Emacs major mode for writing formatted comic book scripts, based on Vance L. Simpson's screenplay.el

Instructions:

TAB-ENTER:  Start a new page
TAB-TAB-ENTER:  Start a new panel
TAB-TAB-TAB-ENTER: Start a new dialog

The mode remembers the last page/panel number that was entered, I'm working on having it check up and down to see if it needs to repaginate (or repanelate?) the blocks.
